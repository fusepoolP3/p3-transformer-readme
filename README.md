# `<name>` Transformer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fusepoolP3/p3-pipeline-transformer.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fusepoolP3/p3-pipeline-transformer)
Introduction:
* Readme should always start with a short introduction
* Around 3-6 sentences
* What is it and what is it doing
* The Travis build status image (if available) should be added to the readme (*suggested by Luigi*)
* Add the links to the JIRA issues at the end of the readme (*suggested by Luigi*)

## Try it out
* Shows the minimum step needed to see some action
* This section should be omitted if it can't be short 
* It should use the latest released version (see [here](https://help.github.com/articles/linking-to-releases/)) and not the sources
* *Suggested by Reto*

## Compiling and Running
* Most readmes already contain such information under different chapternames (*Building and running*, *Install and run*, *Building from source*, etc.)
* How to build it from source and run it
* (How to run it as binary)
* What are the commandline options

## Usage
* Most readmes already contain such information in some form
* How to invoke the transformer using GET and POST
* cURL based examples
* Can contain subchapters for better readability
* Codes and examples should be `code formated` 

## Additional chapters
* Any additional chapter should come after the *Try it out*, *Compiling and Running* and *Usage* chapters for better readability
